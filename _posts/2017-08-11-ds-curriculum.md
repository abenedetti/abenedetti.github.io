Inspired by [Clare's website](http://datasciencemasters.org), I decided to create my own data science learning path. The primarily objective is to keep a record of completed steps and future milestones as well as share suggestions and url with other people.

Here's the content updated on 30th of July 2018:

### Title: [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
- **Provided by:**<br> [![coursera](/images/2017-08-11-ds-curriculum/coursera.png)](https://www.coursera.org/)
- **Type:** Online course
- **Syllabus:** 9 modules + final capstone project
- **Status:** Completed
- **Notes:** Good introductory course that let you have a taste of exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, regression models & machine learning, while learning the R language.

### Title: [Statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)
- **Provided by:**<br> [![khan_academy](/images/2017-08-11-ds-curriculum/khan_academy.jpg)](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
- **Type:** Online course
- **Syllabus:** Small videos, transcripts & exercises
- **Status:** Underway
- **Notes:** I was a bit skeptical about the course contents, but I decided to give it a try during holidays. I have to say that both the contents and the platform were nice to use, even on a mobile device.

### Title: [Introduction to Computing for Data Analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computing-for-data-analysis)

- **Type:** Online course
- **Syllabus:** Small videos, jupyter notebooks in python to complete
- **Status:** Completed
- **Notes:** Starting course about numerical computing, with an eye on data-intensive techniques. I suggest to take an introductory Python course before enrolling in this one.

### Title: [Introduction to Analytics Modeling](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-analytics-modeling-gtx-isye6501x-1)
- **Provided by:**<br> [![edx](/images/2017-08-11-ds-curriculum/edx.png)](https://www.edx.org/)
