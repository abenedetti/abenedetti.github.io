[uTest](https://www.utest.com/) is a professional network for Testers, born on 2007, which has two *souls*:

* the *community* that behaves like a social network dedicated to the testing world
* the *platform* that gives you the opportunity to earn some money, and eventually let you grow as a testing professional

I do not remember with precision why but at some point the words "testing" and "social network" arose together in my mind. Next thought was "it would be nice if someone built something that let you search IT issues exploiting the web and with a social network flavor...". I googled a little bit and... a new term entered in my dictionary: "uTest" !

I signed up on 2015, and during the first two years, I became further and further engaged in the community as well as in the testing activities with over 300 test cycles made. I also was able to reach the silver rating in the functional area.
From late 2017 I've reduced the testing activities as a started sharpening my skills in the analytics field (take a look at this [post](http://alessiobenedetti.com/2017/08/11/ds-curriculum/)), but I kept being active in the community.

uTest was an inspiration for my first two works, two [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps about uTesters stats and location (yep in uTest there are no users... :) but uTesters !). Here's the links for the motivation articles and the apps (you may find them in the projects section on the left menu bar):

* uCount Visualizer: [article](https://www.utest.com/articles/ucount-guess-how-many-we-are) - [app](http://thelab.alessiobenedetti.com/shiny/uCountVis/)
* uGeoTagger: [article](https://www.utest.com/articles/ugeotagger-guess-from-where-we-are) - [app](http://thelab.alessiobenedetti.com/shiny/uGeoTagger/)

I made them during my spare time and it was real fun, nonetheless they were a nice application of some of the new skills I studied.

Should you be interested in uTest take at look at my [utest profile](https://www.utest.com/profile/alessio/about) and my other [articles](https://www.utest.com/profile/alessio/articles).
