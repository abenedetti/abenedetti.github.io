This website was built with Artem's jekyll template: https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexton
Fork it on github or take a look at Artem's repositories: he made other nice templates!

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec serve` to start the Jekyll server.

Artem recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.
